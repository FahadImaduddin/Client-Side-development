    <h1>PIAIC Courses</h1>
    <h2> Artifical Intelligence</h2>
    <p id="aic">
        The Artifical Intelligence program of the PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like Pyhton, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask and teaching deploying practical AI solutions
        and use cases, and ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Cloud Native Computing</h2>
    <p id="cnc">
        The Cloud Native Computing program prepares the student to program in open source technologies like Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaSript, Node.JS, React and React Native while introducting students to development of Microservices and software development
        techniques on cloud platform like AWS.
    </p>

    <h2>Blockchain Computing</h2>
    <p id="bcc">
        The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understanding the blockchain like Ethereum and Hyperleader (Fabric) and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.JS. The program also introduces them to development
        of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and iin-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
    </p>

    <h2>Internet of Things</h2>
    <p id="iot">
        The Internet of Things program introduces the student to open source development technologies like Rust, Embebbed Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, Kubernetes while making them efficient in developing Microservices for IOT Edge, IOT
        Cloud and Voice Computing for device control.
